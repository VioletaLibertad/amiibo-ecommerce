# Amiibo e-commerce

This project was created as a technical challenge in order to apply to the Front End Developer position in Papa Johns. 

The objective was to create a small e-commerce using the [Amiibo API](https://www.amiiboapi.com/).

It was really fun working on this because, although I have used Redux before, I haven't in a while, so I wanted to use the new Redux implementation with Hooks instead of using the old way. It took me a little longer to understand the tricks of it, but I'm thankful for doing it because I learned something I didn't know yesterday. 

My design abilities are certaintly not the best, but I tried to make sure that the code was as beautifully written as I could. 

## How to use it

You have to first clone this proyect, and then run:

```
yarn install
```

and later...

```
yarn start
```

The App will be running on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000/)
